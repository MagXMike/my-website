<h1><u>The Battle of Lagos (1759) during the Seven Years’ War</u></h1>
<h2>⚔️<u> Key Facts</u></h2>
<p>- Date: August 18–19, 1759</p>
<p>- Location: Off the coast of Lagos, Portugal</p>
<p>- Belligerents: Great Britain 🇬🇧 vs. France 🇫🇷</p>
<p>- Outcome: Decisive British victory</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧭<u> Background</u></h2>
<p>- France aimed to unite its Mediterranean and Atlantic fleets to support a planned invasion of Britain.</p>
<p>- Admiral Jean-François de La Clue led the French fleet from Toulon, attempting to slip through the Strait of Gibraltar undetected.</p>
<p>- British Admiral Edward Boscawen, stationed in Gibraltar, was tasked with intercepting them.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🚢<u> The Battle</u></h2>
- The French fleet was spotted after passing Gibraltar and pursued by the British.
- On August 18, the British caught up and engaged the French near Cape St. Vincent.
- Fighting continued into August 19 near Lagos, where several French ships sought refuge in neutral Portuguese waters.
- The British ignored neutrality and captured or destroyed five French ships.
<hr>
<h2>📉<u> Consequences</u></h2>
<p>- The French Mediterranean fleet was crippled, leaving only their Atlantic fleet at Brest.</p>
<p>- This paved the way for Britain’s victory at the Battle of Quiberon Bay later that year, securing naval dominance.</p>
<p>- The win helped thwart France’s invasion plans and solidified British control of the seas.</p>
